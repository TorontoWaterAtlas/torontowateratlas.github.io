**The Toronto Water Atlas seeks to re-examine and understand our relationship with water—not simply as a natural resource or a problem to be managed, but as a life-giving source, and a connector of people and of communities.** It is an imaginative, interactive, and collaborative project that re-envisions the role of water in shaping the present and future of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA), and the GTHA’s relationship with its rivers, creeks, and waterways. This Atlas is not simply a map of water systems or flood risks — it aims to be an artistic and critical examination of our relationship with water. As Toronto faces rising challenges from climate change, urban expansion, and social inequity, water remains both a vital resource and an area of conflict. This Atlas aims to shift the conversation from managing water to living with water—considering it as a shaper of ecosystems, cultures, and communities.

Water in Toronto is often hidden—buried rivers run beneath our feet, and stormwater systems work quietly, out of sight, until something goes wrong (like flooding). Yet water is deeply intertwined with the city’s past, present, and future. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Lake Ontario was a key port that enabled trade and transport, connecting Toronto to regional markets across the Great Lakes and beyond. The Humber and Don Rivers brought early settlers and traders into the city, and these waterways shaped the city’s early economy, transport, and settlement patterns. The rivers and creeks that used to run through Toronto were celebrated and cherished parts of the city. Today, they are buried and hidden beneath concrete, nowhere to be seen! Yet as climate change drives more frequent and intense storms, these buried waterways resurface as floods. If we don’t take an alternate approach that better understands and respects our relationship with water, flooding events will escalate and become more frequent in the future, impacting both urban infrastructure and communities for the worse.

Questions and issues related to water—our rivers, lakes, and hidden creeks—are also inherently political. Access to water, decisions about where rivers flow and where they are buried, and who is protected from flooding are all shaped by the broad socio-political power dynamics in the city. The Atlas seeks to render visible these dynamics, showcasing how water issues are tied up with housing, zoning, economic inequality, and environmental justice. 

This project is an invitation to **critique, speculate, and create**. It asks: How do we think differently about water? What if we embraced water as a connector of communities, not just a resource to be controlled? What would Toronto look like if we opened up our buried rivers, expanded our blue-green spaces, or designed our neighborhoods to adapt to rising water? For example, envision Taddle Creek—currently buried beneath Philosopher’s Walk—resurfaced as a public, blue-green corridor connecting neighborhoods all the way from Wychwood Park to the Harbourfront. The creek’s restored path could bring back a vibrant, biodiverse habitat into the urban landscape, which would offer an accessible green space that enhances community life and reduces flood risk. Or imagine a Don River, where seasonal floodplains are transformed into parklands that naturally adapt to changing water levels, creating lively public spaces for recreation and ecological education.

Through this project, artists, scientists, academics, environmental activists, and community members will have the chance to speculate, reimagine, and create an atlas that not only captures diverse water-related futures of Toronto but also critiques present urban policies, design practices, and environmental priorities. In co-creating this playful, speculative, and generative artifact, participants will have the opportunity to contribute their own stories, visions, and insights about Toronto’s waterways. Taken together, these will form an alternate collective understanding about this natural resource, our relationship to it, and a re-imagination of what Toronto’s future with water could look like.
